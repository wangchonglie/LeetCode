# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

```python
def find_anagrams(s: str, p: str)->list:
    m = [0] * 26
    result = []
    for c in p:
        m[ord(c) - 97] += 1
    current = [0] * 26
    length = len(p)
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        current[ord(c) - 97] += 1
        if i >= length:
            current[ord(s[i - length]) - 97] -= 1
        if current == m:
            result.append(i - length + 1)
    return result
s = "cbaebabacd"
p = "abc"
print(find_anagrams(s, p)) # [0, 6]
```
